### Interference 1D Lattice

Scattering from long boxes distributed along a one-dimensional lattice.

* The particles are long boxes.
* Each box has a length of $1000$ nm, a width of $10$ nm and a height of $15$ nm.
* The particles are placed along a one-dimensional lattice on top of a substrate.
* They are rotated in the $(x,y)$ plane by $10^{\circ}$ with respect the the $x$-axis of the reference cartesian frame.
* The 1D lattice is characterized by a lattice length of $30$ nm.
* The lattice's base vector coincides with $x$-axis of the reference cartesian frame.
* The wavelength is equal to $24$ $\unicode{x212B}$.
* The incident angles are $\alpha\_i = 0.2 ^{\circ}$ and $\phi\_i = 0^{\circ}$.

> #### Note:
> * By default, the axis of the one-dimensional lattice is the $x$-axis. A rotation can be applied to the particles (like in this example) or to the 1D lattice.  

> * In the real-space model picture, the full length of a boxes cannot be seen as it is too large compared to its width and heigth.
