      <description>Cylinders in Born Approximation Scattering from a monodisperse distribution of cylinders using the Born approximation.
 The cylinders are all identical with radii and heights equal to 5 nanometers. The wavelength is equal to 1 Å. The incident angles are equal to αi = 0.2° and Φi=0°. There is no substrate (particles are embedded in the air layer), hence no refraction, hence no distorted waves, hence DWBA boils down to regular Born approximation.</description>

      <description>Scattering from a monodisperse distribution of cylindrical particles using the Distorted Wave Born Approxiamtion (DWBA).
This example is similar to the simulation in Born Approximation, CylindersInBA, but now the particles sit on top of a substrate. Therefore incoming and scattered waves are distorted by reflections from the substrate surface, as described by the DWBA.
 The distribution of cylinders is monodisperse with heights and radii of 5 nm. The wavelength is equal to 1 Å.</description>

      <description>Cylinders with size distribution Scattering from a polydisperse distribution of cylinders in Born Approximation.
 The average radii and heights of the cylinders are equal to 5 nm. The radii of the cylinders vary according to a normal distribution with a standard deviation σ equal to 0.2 times the average radius. The wavelength is equal to 1 Å. The incident angles are equal to αi = 0.2°and Φi = 0°.</description>
