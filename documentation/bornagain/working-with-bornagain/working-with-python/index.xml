      <description>Material types Currently two material types are available in BornAgain: HomogeneousMaterial and MaterialBySLD.
First of them is created with the following syntax:
magnetization = ba.kvector_t(1.0, 0.0, 0.0) &amp;lt;material&amp;gt; = ba.HomogeneousMaterial(&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;, delta, beta, magnetization)  where name is the arbitrary name of the material associated with its complex refractive index $n = 1 - delta + i \cdot beta$. magnetization defines a 3D magnetization vector (in A/m). Variable &amp;lt;material&amp;gt; is later used when referring to this particular material.</description>
